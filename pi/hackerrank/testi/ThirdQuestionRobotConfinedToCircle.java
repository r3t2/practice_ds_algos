/*
Robot repeats a command infinetely. 
Command consists of G, L, R in any combination.
G -> go forward (moves by 1 unit for example)
L -> turn left (no position change. only orientation)
R -> turn right (no position change. only orientation)


Is there a circle of some finite radius that robot never crosses?
